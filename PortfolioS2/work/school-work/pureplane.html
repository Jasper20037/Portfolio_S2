        <h2>Pure plane</h2>
        <p>
            For the media production lessons we had to create a logo, i had a hard time coming up with something i wanted to make a logo for. But when i was talking about it with a collegue she jokingly said "Do it about a climate neutral airline" beceause Extincion Rebelion was coming to demonstrate later that week
            But i thought it was actually a pretty good idea, so i made some sketches and after that starter working in adobe illustrator, under this text you can see the mockup that i created with the logo, and you can download the logo <a href="../../static/img/all-work/PurePlane.svg" download>here</a> (in SVG format)
