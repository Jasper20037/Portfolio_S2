                <p>
                    My name is Jasper van den Heuvel, I'm a 20 year old ICT & Media design student at Fontys university of applied sciences in Eindhoven which is where i also live! i started with the ICT & Media design study in 2022. before this i studied <i>application and media developer</i> at Summa College, from 2019 until 2022! I really enjoyed this study and it made clear for me that i like the webdevlopment side a lot!
                    Thats is one of the main reasons why i chose Media design. Besides school i also work at Eindhoven Airport as <i>Flow coordinator</i>, i started working at Eindhoven Airport in the summer of 2022 as host beceause of the long lines, and at the end of 2022 i got promoted &#58;&#41;

                                    <b><i>What is it?</i></b><br>
                                    <b>Iterations:</b> the ongoing process of product improvement in small successive steps. <br>
                                    <b>User research:</b> research into the needs, wishes and behavior of end users by doing desk research and interviews and gathering feedback by conducting user tests.
                                    </p>

                                    <br><b><i>What i did:</i></b><br>
                                    I really like interactive media beceause it is the time where you can do some research which may give you some intresting results, and with the results you are able to create something creative. 
                                    Which i think is so cool, you go from completely nothing to a whole design just by doing interviews an surveys etc. <br><br>
                                    <b>Until now i did the following:</b>

                                    <b>Proofs of concepts (pocs):</b> programming small pocs to focus on basic skills. Integrating various smaller pocs into a larger application. The focus is a fundamental understanding of JavaScript.<br><br>
                                    <b>Validated requirements:</b> to be determined by the bachelor student by doing research (end users, stakeholders). For the AD students: given in advance in the instructions of exercises and assignments.<br><br>
                                    <b>Version control tools:</b> a tool (e.g. GitHub, GitLab) to monitor your progress and backup your work (push, pull, commit).<br><br>

                                    This is the learning outcome i am most excited about, the part where you really build the thing where you have been doing research etc. for for the past few weeks, now it really starts coming to life!  <br><br>
