            <h2>The Assignment:</h2>
            <p> 
                For this assignment we had to find examples of for the 9 different principles of designing, this was an intresting assignment! 
                At first i had a hard time making this assignment beceause i did not really understand (i missed the lesson) this drained some motivation which resulted in not being able to finish it on time. 
                But looking back on the assignment i kinda liked it, and i feel like i learned a lot from it!
