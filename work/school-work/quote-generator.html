            <h2>The idea:</h2>
            <p> 
                This was my first DOM assiment, i came up with the idea to make a quote generator, because i thought it would be fun to make.
                i made te assignment using by putting quotes inside of an array, and i made a button to get a new quote on every click. i did this using DOM ofcourse!
                I really enjoyed makin this assignment, i had worked with an arrays like this before but it was a long time ago, so it was fun to do it again.
            </p>

            <h2>What i learned:</h2>
            <p> 
                As i said i worked with an arrays in this way before in jasvascript, but it was a long time ago, so i had to look up how to do some thing again, for example how i could display the data from the array.
                But after a little research i understood how it worked again, and i could start working on the assignment (creating the elements and showing the data from the array etc.).
