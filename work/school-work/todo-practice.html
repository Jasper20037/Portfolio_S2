            <h2>The Idea:</h2>
            <p> 
                When coming up with ideas for projects i could build for FED/Programming i searched a bit around the internet and that is
                when i came up with the idea to make a todo list. I found a tutorial on youtube and followed it, but i did not just copy i made sure i understood what happend and add my own twist to it. I added localStorage and a few other things to make it my own.
            </p>

            <h2>What i learned:</h2>
            <p> 
                The bigges thing i learned was how to use localStorage, i had only used it a few times before and it was really interesting to learn how to use it, and see what sort of cool things you can do with it.
                I also learned how to use the DOM, i had used it before but not to this extent, I learned how to use the DOM to get the value of an input field and use it inside of a function.
