            <h2>The Idea:</h2>
            <p> 
                The same as with the modal, i made a accordion before (on my previous portfolio) but again, at that time i did not really understand what i was doing
                and i followed a tutorial. So i wanted to make a accordion again, this time i still did it having a tutorial by my side but i first tried it myself and then watched the tutorial
                to see if i did it right. And i did! i am proud of the result and i feel like i really understand what i am doing now.
            </p>

            <h2>What i learned:</h2>
            <p> 
                And here again, i do not feel like i <b>really</b> learned aything new but i have a better understanding of what is happening.
                And i really know what i am doing now, i can make a accordion without a tutorial and i am proud of that.
