            <h2>The idea:</h2>
            <p> 
                And then..... The practice i enjoyed the most! I really liked working with JSON and by doing the previous practices it was so easy!
                I did not use a tutorial at all, i just started and it went really well. I did not have any problems and i really enjoyed working on the project.
                It's all manipulated with DOM i did not write any HTML code myself, i just used the DOM to create the elements and append them to the page. ITS SO COOL!

            <h2>What i learned:</h2>
            <p> 
                During this assignment the thing i really feel like i learned was how to: displaying data from the JSON on a webpage.
                I had done this before but that was a long time ago, and the JSON together with the DOM? Ohh i enjoyed this practice so much!
