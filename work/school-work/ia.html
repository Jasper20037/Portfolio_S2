            <h2>The Assignment:</h2>
            <p> 
                With this assignment we had to research the <i>Information Architecture</i> of different websites to see how they do it, compare the differences between the <i>Information Architecture's</i> <br><br>
                I liked this assignemnt, i liked doing the research and to paying attention to things you normally don't "Really" pay attention too.

            <h2>What i learned:</h2>
            <p> 
                I feel like i learned a lot during this assignment, you really start to pay attention to things you normally don't really pay attention too and start thinking of what might be the reason behind the choises of the designers behind that website! <br>
                <br> For example, i learned:
                <ul>
                    <li>That there is a lot of difference between websites that sell kind of the same products</li>
                    <li>If you don't have a good information architecture you are giving the user a harder time finding something</li>
                </ul>
