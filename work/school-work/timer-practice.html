            <h2>The idea:</h2>
            <p> 
                This idea i again got from a youtube video, i wanted to make a stopwatch that would be able to be paused, started again and reseted.
                By following the video i learned how to use the DOM to manipulate the html and css, and how to use javascript to make the stopwatch work.
                But i did not just follow the video, i really wanted to understand what i was doing, so i followed the video but paused it at times to first try myself and then see if i did it right.
            </p>
