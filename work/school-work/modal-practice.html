            <h2>The idea:</h2>
            <p> 
                I had build a modal before, in this portfolio even but at that time i did not really understand what i was doing and followed a turorial.
                That is why i wanted to try and build a modal again, but this time without a tutorial and with a better understanding of what i was doing. 
                and i feel like i did a great job! i really understand what i am doing now and i am proud of the result.
            </p>
