            <h2>Figma prototype:</h2>
            <p> 
                After doing the research and coming up with the idea, i made a prototype in figma, i made a prototype for the desktop version of the extension.
                i made the the prototype using Figma because i already had a lot of experience with Figma and because Figma is a really good tool for making prototypes, it is easy to use and it has a lot of features that make it easy to make an (interactive) prototype.
                With the FIgma prototype i made i can start testing the User's experience to see if the design is good and if the user can easily use the extension.

            <h2>Testing:</h2>
            <p> 
                After creating the interactive prototype i could start testing, i tested the prototype with 3 people, 
                i asked them to do a few tasks and i watched them do it, i also asked them to think out loud so i could hear what they were thinking while doing the tasks.   
                These test were really helpful, i learned a lot from them, i learned that the design was good but that there were a few things that could be improved. (you will learn about them in the next section)

            <h2>Improvements:</h2>
            <p> 
                After the testing i could start improving the figma prototype, i made a few changes to the design, i made the design more clear and i made it easier to use.
                Things tester had a hard time with was:
                <ol>
                    <li>Finding the play button</li>
                    <li>The testers wanted to know if the interactive card was going to be a game or video</li>
                    <li>Understanding how the timeline worked</li>
                </ol>
                <br>
                I did the following to improve the design:
                <ol>
                    <li>Creating a more clear play button using the text "Play"</li>
                    <li>Giving the user more info by using icons (Game controller or play button)</li>
                    <li>A more clear way of showing the timeline and adding the year above the card</li>
                </ol>
                <br>
                After these improvements i tested the prototype again and the testers had no hard time weith the above mentioned problems, 
                i only adjusted the a bit to fit the "Great Greek Love" theme better.
