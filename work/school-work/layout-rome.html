            <h2>The idea!</h2>
            <p> 
                For our media production lesson we had to create a layout with our own photo's in indesign, and since i went to rome last january (I fell a day before the trip that's why i look like that haha) i tought it was a great idea to use my photos from Rome in the layout.

            <h2>Development process</h2>
            <p> 
                I did not really have an idea of an layout, so i searched online for some inspiration and played around a bit in indesign, i wanted the images to overlap eachother to get a sort of feeling of depth.

                I think the result turned out okay i think there is a lot to improve, but for a first time..... it's not that bad right? <br>
