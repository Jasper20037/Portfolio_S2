            <h2>What i did:</h2>
            <p> 
                For the programming lesson, we had a lesson about Javascript from metaxas. I really like these lessons, Metaxas explains it in a funny, understandable and intresting way! Even if he explains for 4 hours, you keep listening!
                This programming lesson we were going to learn how to build a calculator in javascript. I've worked with javascript before but i forgot a lot of stuff, i really want to get back into it beceause i think javascript is really intresting and usefull
                So togheter with metaxas i build the calculator in javascript.
            </p>

            <h2>What i learned</h2>
            <p> 
                As i said i've worked is javascript before, and since this was a beginners assignment i did not "really" learn anything new but it was a refreshment of what i knew already from my previous education.
                Nontheless i really liked this lesson and what we did!
