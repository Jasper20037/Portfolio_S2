            <h2>The creation of the team:</h2>
            <p> 
                The team was created quickly, we all knew each other from previous classes and we knew that we could work together. As extra we had Vincent, but Vincent ended up leaving the studies a week later.
                but nonetheless we had a good team and we were ready to start working on the project. We all had our own skills and weakneses which made working together great, beceause we could help each other out where needed.
